            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>Free Math is easy to set up, all you need is a standard LMS that can collect files.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Assign problems from your textbook or a worksheet.</li>
                <li>Students complete digital work, save it as a file and submit it through your LMS.</li>
                <li>You download the files in bulk from your LMS as a zip file.</li>
                <li>Load the zip file into Free Math for grading, the app will show you
                    where students struggled the most.
                    Anything you donâ€™t have time to grade gets completion points.</li>
                <li>Save the grading feedback, which generates a zip file filled with
                    individual graded documents for each student.</li>
                <li>Upload the zip file full of documents into your LMS, it will provide the
                    individual graded documents to each student.</li>
                <li>Record the overall grades into your grade book.</li>
            </ol>
                <h2><br />
                    Instructions for Specific LMS Tools</h2>
                <p> LMS products come with features for collecting documents
                    from students and managing them in bulk. These features
                    are often used for grading files like papers or presentations.
                    These types of files must be examined individually for
                    grading. One great advantage of Free Math is that all
                    documents are graded together, with optimized actions for
                    grading similar work.</p>
                    <p> Here are some links to help for managing student files
                        in specific LMS products. As Free Math natively opens
                        and saves zip files, you can often avoid steps related
                        to unzipping downloaded documents and manually creating
                        a new zip of the graded documents when re-uploading.
                        Keep this in mind as you follow these instructions.
