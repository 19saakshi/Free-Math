                <h2>Getting Started</h2>
                    <p>Free Math is easy to set up, all you need is a standard LMS that can
                       collect files.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Assign problems from your textbook or a worksheet.</li>
                    <li>Students complete digital work, save it as a file and submit it through your LMS.</li>
                    <li>You download the files in bulk from your LMS as a zip file.</li>
                    <li>Load the zip file into Free Math for grading, the app will show you
                        where students struggled the most.
                        Anything you donâ€™t have time to grade gets completion points.</li>
                    <li>Save the grading feedback, which generates a zip file filled with
                        individual graded documents for each student.</li>
                    <li>Upload the zip file full of documents into your LMS, it will provide the
                        individual graded documents to each student.</li>
                    <li>Record the overall grades into your grade book.</li></ol>

                <h2>Instructions for Specific LMS Tools</h2>
                <p> LMS products come with features for collecting documents
                    from students and managing them in bulk. These features
                    are often used for grading files like papers or presentations.
                    These types of files must be examined individually for
                    grading. One great advantage of Free Math is that all
                    documents are graded together, with optimized actions for
                    grading similar work.</p>
                    <p> Here are some links to help for managing student files
                        in specific LMS products. As Free Math natively opens
                        and saves zip files, you can often avoid steps related
                        to unzipping downloaded documents and manually creating
                        a new zip of the graded documents when re-uploading.
                        Keep this in mind as you follow these instructions.

                <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <p><b>Does Free Math solve math problems?</b></p>
                <p>No, Free Math allows students to record their work, but does not solve problems automatically.</p>
                <p><b>Where are the problems for Free Math?</b></p>
                <p>Free Math is designed to work with any existing exercises from a book, worksheet or digital problem bank. Students copy problems into Free Math just as they would with a paper notebook.</p>
                <p><b>Where is the answer key for grading?</b></p>
                <p>There is no need to provide Free Math with an answer key. The grading page finds similar student answers on each problem, you only need to grade each final answer once and confirm that work was provided by each student to justify reaching their answer.</p>
                <p><b>If students submit files for their assignments, how does the system prevent cheating?</b></p>
                <p>In addition to comparing individual answers, Free Math also compares students' overall documents for similarity. If two or more documents share a lot of work, they will be flagged for you to review side by side.</p>
                <p><b>Isn't the point of digital homework to avoid doing the grading yourself?</b></p>
                <p>Computers are great for automating away repetitive tasks. Fully automated grading tools do not provide the same detailed feedback as teacher, and most have no ability to determine if an answer is partially correct. Free Math is taking a different approach, recognizing that grading is a creative task with repetitive elements. The software allows bulk actions for similar work, but gives you the flexibility to provide partial credit and detailed feedback in a way algorithmic grading cannot today. Feedback provided from a teacher is a great learning tool, but grading everything produced by your students just isn't feasible. Free Math helps sort through student work to show what needs feedback most urgently.</p>
