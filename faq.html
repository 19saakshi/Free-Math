            <h2>FAQ</h2>
                <p><b>Does Free Math solve math problems?</b></p>
                <p>No, Free Math allows students to record their work, but does not solve problems automatically.</p>
                <p><b>Where are the problems for Free Math?</b></p>
                <p>Free Math is designed to work with any existing exercises from a book,
                   worksheet or digital problem bank. Students copy problems into Free Math
                   just as they would with a paper notebook.</p>
                <p><b>Why doesn't Free Math show auto-saved recovered documents on my Chromebook,
                      like it does on my other devices?</b></p>
                <p>During development, we did confirm that Free Math could auto-save into a temporary
                   location on all browsers, including the Chrome browser on Chromebooks. Unfortunately,
                   the technology used for this feature appears to be disabled by some district-managed
                   Chromebooks. If you are using Chromebooks, your students should have Google accounts
                   that will allow them to use our new feature to save directly to Google Drive and Classroom.
                </p>
                <p><b>Where is the answer key for grading?</b></p>
                <p>There is no need to provide Free Math with an answer key. The grading page finds
                   similar student answers on each problem, you only need to grade each final answer
                   once and confirm that work was provided by each student to justify reaching their answer.
                   The expectation is not that all problems need to be graded every day, so the software
                   by default gives completion points to submitted solutions. It also shows an overview
                   of the assignment, based on diversity of answers submitted for each question, so you can see
                   which problems are likely the most useful to grade and give feedback on.</p>
                <p><b>If students submit files for their assignments, how does the system prevent cheating?</b></p>
                <p>In addition to comparing individual answers, Free Math also compares students' overall
                   documents for similarity. If two or more documents share a lot of work, they will be
                   flagged for you to review side by side.</p>
                <p><b>Isn't the point of digital homework to avoid doing the grading yourself?</b></p>
                <p>Computers are great for automating away repetitive tasks. Fully automated grading
                   tools do not provide the same detailed feedback as teacher, and most have no ability
                   to determine if an answer is partially correct. Free Math is taking a different approach,
                   recognizing that grading is a creative task with repetitive elements. The software allows
                   bulk actions for similar work, but gives you the flexibility to provide partial credit and
                   detailed feedback in a way algorithmic grading cannot today. Feedback provided from a
                   teacher is a great learning tool, but grading everything produced by your students just
                   isn't feasible. Free Math helps sort through student work to show what needs feedback
                   most urgently.
